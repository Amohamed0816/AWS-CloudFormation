# AWS CloudFormation Repository

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my AWS CloudFormation Repositoryâ€”a space where technology meets joy! ðŸš€ This collection of AWS CloudFormation templates and configurations is designed not only for showcasing various infrastructure deployments but also to share my passion for cloud technologies.

## [App-Infrastructure](app-infrastructure)

**Overview:** Dive into the world of AWS infrastructure with a smile! Deploy a basic AWS setup that not only demonstrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and AWS service integration but also embraces best practices for scalability and security.

## [HA WebServer](ha-webserver)

**Overview:** Elevate your AWS journey with high-fives! ðŸŒŸ Deploy a high-availability web application on AWS using CloudFormation templates. This project goes beyond the basics, featuring an Application Load Balancer (ALB), Amazon RDS for a robust database, AWS WAF for web application security, and EC2 instances spread across multiple availability zones.

Feel free to explore, learn, and share your thoughts! ðŸ“šâœ¨
